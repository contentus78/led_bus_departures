# led_bus_departures
A project to display bus departure times on a LED panel.

Work in progress.

## To-do
- incorporate delays in calculation
- implement fetching into main script, think about fetch intervals
- fetch every 30 seconds but calculate in real time or every 5 seconds
- tidy up code

## Nice to have
- since fetching only retrieves limited amount of future data, consider using fixed schedule as fallback
